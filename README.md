# Anime Characters Website
This is a simple frontend project created using HTML and CSS.  
The website displays different anime series and allows users to navigate to individual anime pages to view characters and related content.

The main goal of this project was to practice frontend fundamentals such as page structure, navigation, styling, and folder organization.

## Live Website

## Project Description
The website contains multiple anime sections including Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and Bleach.  
Each anime has its own page, and the homepage acts as a central navigation point.

This project helped me understand:
- How to organize files and folders properly
- How relative paths work in HTML
- How to deploy a static website using GitHub Pages
- How to make a layout responsive using CSS

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3
