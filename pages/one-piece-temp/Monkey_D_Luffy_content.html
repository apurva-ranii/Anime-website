        Luffy draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate Shanks, who saved his life, sacrificed an arm for him, and entrusted him with his treasured straw hat. By accident, Luffy ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi, a Devil Fruit that granted his body rubber-like properties, shaping his unique fighting style.
