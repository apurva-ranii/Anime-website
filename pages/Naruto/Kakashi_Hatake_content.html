        Kakashi is the son of Sakumo Hatake, a legendary ninja known as the "White Fang of the Leaf."

        During the Third Great Ninja War, Kakashi served under Minato Namikaze alongside Obito Uchiha and Rin Nohara.
        He received the Sharingan from Obito as a final gift, an event that deeply shaped his life.
