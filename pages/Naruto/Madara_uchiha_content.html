    <h1>Madara Uchiha</h1>

    <p class="heading">Overview</p>
    <p>
        Madara Uchiha is one of the primary antagonists in the Naruto manga and anime series created by Masashi Kishimoto.
        He is a legendary shinobi of the Uchiha clan and one of the co-founders of the Hidden Leaf Village alongside
        Hashirama Senju.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Early Life</p>
    <p>
        Madara was born during a time of constant war between ninja clans. As a child, he befriended Hashirama Senju,
        but their friendship was torn apart by the long-standing conflict between the Uchiha and Senju clans.
        <br>
        After losing his brothers, especially Izuna, Madara grew bitter and came to believe that true peace could
        never be achieved through trust alone.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Founding of Konoha</p>
    <p>
        Madara and Hashirama eventually set aside their rivalry to create Konohagakure, the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
        While Hashirama believed in cooperation and compassion, Madara favored strength and control.
        Their conflicting ideologies caused Madara to abandon the village.
