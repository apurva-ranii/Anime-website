    <h1>Son Gohan</h1>

    <p class="heading">Overview</p>
    <p>
        Son Gohan (孫 悟飯) is a fictional character from the Japanese manga and anime series 
        <strong>Dragon Ball</strong>, created by Akira Toriyama. He is the elder son of Son Goku 
        and Chi-Chi and is known for being a Saiyan-human hybrid with enormous hidden potential. 
        Unlike his father, Gohan prefers a peaceful life as a scholar rather than constant battle.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Early Life</p>
    <p>
        Gohan first appeared as a four-year-old child with a gentle personality and little interest 
        in fighting. Despite this, his latent power was revealed during moments of intense rage, 
        especially when his loved ones were threatened. After Goku''s death during the Saiyan conflict, 
        Gohan was trained by Piccolo, forming a deep bond that shaped his growth as both a warrior 
        and an individual.

    <p class="heading">Role in the Story</p>
    <p>
        Throughout Dragon Ball Z, Gohan grows from a frightened child into a powerful warrior. 
        His defining moment comes during the Cell Games, where he becomes the first character 
        to achieve the Super Saiyan 2 transformation and ultimately defeats Cell, saving the planet.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Saiyan Powers</p>
    <p>
        As a half-Saiyan, Gohan possesses exceptional potential that surpasses many full-blooded 
        Saiyans. His strength increases dramatically through emotional awakenings rather than 
        constant training, making him unique among the series' fighters.
    </p>

        on a god-like level.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Connection with Family and Allies</p>
    <p>
        Gohan shares strong relationships with his mentor Piccolo, his wife Videl, and his daughter Pan.

        in Gohan's life.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Later Development</p>
    <p>
        As an adult, Gohan becomes a scholar and family man while balancing his responsibilities 
        as a defender of Earth. In <em>Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero</em>, he regains his warrior spirit 
        and unlocks the Beast form, proving himself once again as one of the strongest fighters alive.
