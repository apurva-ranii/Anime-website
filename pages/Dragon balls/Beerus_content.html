    <h1>Beerus</h1>

    <p class="heading">Overview</p>
    <p>
        Beerus, the God of Destruction (破壊神ビルス), is a powerful deity from the
        <strong>Dragon Ball</strong> franchise created by Akira Toriyama. Introduced in
        <em>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods</em>, he is responsible for maintaining universal
        balance through destruction.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Early Life</p>
    <p>
        Beerus is an ancient being who has existed for millions of years. Often sleeping
        for decades at a time, his awakening usually signals major changes in the universe.
        His role contrasts that of the Supreme Kais, who create life.

    <p class="heading">Role in the Story</p>
