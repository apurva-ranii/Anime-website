    <h1>Piccolo</h1>

    <p class="heading">Overview</p>
    <p>
        Piccolo (ピッコロ) is a prominent character from the Japanese manga and anime series 
        <strong>Dragon Ball</strong>, created by Akira Toriyama. Introduced as the reincarnation 
        of the evil King Piccolo, he initially appears as a villain but later evolves into one 
        of Earth's greatest defenders and a trusted ally of Son Goku.

    <p class="heading">Early Life</p>
    <p>
        Piccolo was born as the reincarnation of King Piccolo with the goal of avenging his 
        predecessor's defeat. After losing to Goku in the World Martial Arts Tournament, 
        Piccolo's path gradually changes. It is later revealed that he belongs to the 
        extraterrestrial Namekian race from Planet Namek, not the Demon Clan as previously believed.
