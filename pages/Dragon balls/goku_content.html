    <p class="heading">Overview</p>
    <p>
        Son Goku (孫 悟空) is the main protagonist of the Japanese manga and anime series 
        <strong>Dragon Ball</strong>, created by Akira Toriyama. Inspired by the legendary

    <p class="heading">Early Life</p>
    <p>
        Born as Kakarot on Planet Vegeta, Goku belongs to the nearly extinct Saiyan race. 
        He was sent to Earth as an infant before his home planet was destroyed by Frieza. 
        Found and raised by a kind martial artist named Grandpa Gohan, Goku grew up in the 
        mountains. After suffering a head injury as a child, his aggressive Saiyan nature 
        disappeared, turning him into a cheerful and kind-hearted boy.
