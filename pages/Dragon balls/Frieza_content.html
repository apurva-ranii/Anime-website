    <h1>Frieza</h1>

    <p class="heading">Overview</p>
    <p>
        Frieza (フリーザ) is one of the main antagonists of the <strong>Dragon Ball</strong> series,
        created by Akira Toriyama. Introduced during the Planet Namek saga, he is a ruthless
        galactic tyrant feared across the universe and is widely regarded as Goku's greatest
        enemy.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Early Life</p>
    <p>
        Frieza was born into a powerful alien family that controlled vast portions of the
        universe. Raised as a conqueror, he ruled through fear and destruction. His hatred
        of the Saiyan race led him to destroy Planet Vegeta, unknowingly setting in motion
        the events that would lead to his downfall.

    <p class="heading">Personality</p>
    <p>Frieza is best described as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cruel, sadistic, and merciless</li>
        <li>Arrogant and power-obsessed</li>
        <li>Manipulative and intelligent</li>
        <li>Polite in speech yet brutal in action</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Despite his refined manner of speaking, Frieza shows no compassion and takes pleasure
        in domination, betrayal, and destruction.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Role in the Story</p>
    <p>
        Frieza serves as the main villain of the Namek saga, seeking immortality through the
        Dragon Balls. His actions lead to countless deaths and trigger Goku's legendary
        transformation into a Super Saiyan for the first time.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Alien Powers</p>
    <p>
        Born with extraordinary strength, Frieza possesses immense natural power even
        without training. To control his overwhelming energy, he developed multiple
        transformation forms that suppress or release his true strength.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Powers and Abilities</p>
    <p>Frieza's abilities include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Multiple transformation forms</li>
        <li>Planet-destroying energy attacks</li>
        <li>Death Beam and Death Ball techniques</li>
        <li>Flight, telekinesis, and space survival</li>
        <li>Golden and Black Frieza transformations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Through later training, Frieza unlocks new forms that allow him to rival gods and
        challenge even Goku and Vegeta at their strongest.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Connection with Goku</p>
    <p>
        Frieza's rivalry with Goku defines much of Dragon Ball Z. He is responsible for the
        deaths of Goku's friends and the destruction of the Saiyan race, making their conflict
        deeply personal and one of the most iconic rivalries in anime history.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Later Development</p>
    <p>
        Frieza returns multiple times through resurrection and alternate timelines. In
        <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, he regains prominence by achieving new transformations
        such as Golden Frieza and Black Frieza, proving his continued threat to the universe.
    </p>

    <p class="heading">Legacy</p>
    <p>Frieza symbolizes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute tyranny and cruelty</li>
        <li>The consequences of unchecked power</li>
        <li>The catalyst for Goku's greatest transformation</li>
        <li>One of anime's most iconic villains</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        From feared emperor to recurring menace, Frieza remains one of the most memorable
        and influential antagonists in the Dragon Ball franchise.
