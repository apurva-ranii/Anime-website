        Chopper was born on Drum Island as a reindeer with a blue nose, which caused him to be rejected by his herd. After eating the Human-Human Fruit, he gained human intelligence and the ability to transform, which further isolated him. He was eventually taken in by Doctor Hiriluk, who became his mentor and inspired his dream of becoming a great doctor.
